## Bug 2: Free Shipping Incorrectly Applied Below Threshold
- **Bug ID**: **BUG-002**
- **Feature**: Shipping Cost Changes
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Open

### Environment
- **OS**: MAC OS
- **Browsers**: Chrome Version 131.0.6778.140
- **Test Data**: Cart total = $19.99

### Description
Free shipping is applied incorrectly for cart totals below the $20 threshold. Additionally, when the cart total crosses the free shipping threshold and is then decreased below $20, standard shipping costs fail to reapply dynamically.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Add products to the cart totaling $19.99.
2. Proceed to checkout.
3. Verify the shipping costs.
4. Incrementally increase the cart total to exceed $20 and confirm that free shipping is applied.
5. Decrease the cart total below $20 and observe the shipping cost.

### Expected Outcome
- Standard shipping cost should apply for cart totals below $20.
- If the cart total drops below the threshold after free shipping is applied, standard shipping costs should be reinstated dynamically.

### Actual Outcome
- Free shipping is incorrectly applied below the $20 threshold.
- Standard shipping fails to reapply dynamically when the cart total drops below $20 after crossing the free shipping threshold.

### Steps to Reproduce

2. Incrementally add products to the cart until the total exceeds $20.
3. Observe the shipping cost.

### Expected Outcome
Free shipping should be applied dynamically as the cart total crosses $20.

### Actual Outcome
Standard shipping cost persists until the page is refreshed.
